# Allkinds
Allkinds allows individuals to find like-minded people or organizations in a very precise and private manner. This happens in a very natural way - by asking questions about what people consider important and answering questions from other people. Allkinds then calculates the cohesion score by the number of the same questions weighted on the importance of every question for each user.

## Introduction
### Problem
Despite the presence of numerous solutions in the market, the issue of loneliness is worsening. Having a Facebook 'friend' does not equate to having a genuine friend, and Tinder-like matches often fail to lead to sustainable relationships.
People spend too much time on social media and dating services, yet they only establish shallow connections. As a result, approximately 60% of the global population considers themselves either lonely, left out, or lacking meaningful relationships.
### Solution
Allkinds is a web3 protocol that empowers individuals and organizations to create comprehensive meta profiles encompassing their values, traits, interests, and more. By comparing these meta profiles with others, Allkinds enables users to discover precisely aligned like-minded individuals or organizations.
