    <h3>How to find like-minded</h3>

    <p>
      When we meet new people, we begin by asking questions. Through this process, we
      learn from each other and try to understand one another. Based on the answers, we
      determine whether this person is the right one to build a relationship with or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Allkinds operates in a similar manner. <br />
      Members can anonymously ask questions in a yes/no format about what they consider
      important or interesting. They answer these questions themselves and answer
      questions from other people indicating the importance of each question with a +/-
      number.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then people can search for those who resonates with their answers the most. The
      cohesion score is calculated as a percentage of the same answers to the same
      questions weighted upon importances from both members.
    </p>

    <p>Once people find each other that can connect and:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>share informations about each other</li>
      <li>compare answers thus learning about each other</li>
      <li>send messages</li>
      <li>send coins.</li>
    </ul>
