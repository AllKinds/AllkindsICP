    <h3>Seasons.</h3>
    <p>
      Allkinds is an infinite social project. <br />
      What means ‘infinite’ here is that it’s projects members who decide upon the future
      development.<br /><br />

      Allkinds runs in seasons. Every season has a start date and is limited in time.
      <br /><br />Every season had it’s major goal that should be achieved as a collective
      group effort. <br /><br />
    </p>
    <h3>Proposals</h3>
    <p>
      During a season members can submit proposals for the following seasons and vote on
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such proposals can cover any topics that the members consider important/interesting
      (future features, locations to open, tokenomics, etc.)<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Allkinds voting on proposals based on liquid democracy - you can vote by yourself or
      delegate you vote to other member.
    </p>

    <p>
      People vote on proposals by submitting an answer and stacking Allkinds virtual coins
      - Kins.
    </p>
