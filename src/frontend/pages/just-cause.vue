      I personally believe that the just cause of allkinds should be for something that’s
      worth getting out of the bed in the morning and it should not benefit you but the
      people out there… I think in the future people should be able to surround like
      minded people (think also in terms of people of the same meme and the same context)
      with ease no matter the location, the language or the ethnics. Or even bigger the
      word loneliness is a thing of the past that parents tell their children as part of
      scary stories. I think that’s it.

      I see Allkinds as a tool for initiating a diverse range of meaningful connections.
      If it is successfull it will provide a very fast way to find the best connection for
      your circumstances and aspirations. It will help to solve coordination problems
      while still preserving your privacy. At the same time it will improve compassion and
      avoids filter bubbles and isolation.

      Once I found this study about What makes people happy and discovered that it’s
      relationships is what makes you really happy. It can be romantic, or a true
      friendship, or any other types of connections. And it’s not about quantity, it’s
      about quality, it’s depth. That what fulfils. Than it turned out that the quality of
      relationships is also the #1 factor that influences our both mental and physical
      health. We need people around, need those who will be able to understand us, to
      accept, where one can be truly himself. It also fits the Infinite Game concept well.
      We cannot win a finite game if we talk about true meaningful relationships. It’s the
      process and a moment after moment that we live together through. Allkinds can be an
      Infinite Game that totally depends on it’s players. Both in the content and
      mechanics. So Just Cause of the project can be something like.. let’s play this
      infinite game with the goal to make people happy.

      Ещё можно через "а давайте поможем друг другу стать счастливее" . Всмысле это может
      быть миссией. Чтобы каждый человек вложился в счастье другого через использование
      инструмента.
